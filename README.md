## What is this repo

**BrickGuides** is a public home for my guides on data, AI and Databricks.
Each guide is a short, focused deep dive that comes with code, notebooks and supporting material so you can reuse the ideas in your own projects.

This is a personal learning and sharing project. It is **NOT** an official Databricks repository.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine or Databricks workspace.
2. Import the notebooks in the respective folders (if any) into a Databricks workspace.
3. Attach to a cluster or SQL warehouse and run the notebooks in order.
4. Open the PDF/DOCs (if any) in your machine to follow the narrative guide while you run the examples.

**If you spot an issue or want to suggest an improvement, feel free to open an issue or pull request.**
